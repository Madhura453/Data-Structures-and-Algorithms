To summarize:

Logical OR (||) will stop further recursive calls as soon as one branch returns true.

It short-circuits the recursion, which helps in preventing unnecessary computations, making the code more efficient.

It's crucial for problems like subset sum or backtracking where weâ€™re exploring different possibilities and want to stop early when we find a valid solution.
